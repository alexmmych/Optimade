## **Note that in order for this build to work, the directory must be included in the _"C:/"_ drive, that is due to its dependencies being ordered in that way. If something goes wrong check that the project settings in Visual Studio are setup correctly and are pointing in the right directions** ##

For the moment it is still necessary to import _"libcef.dll"_ , among other dependencies to the "x64/Debug" folder.
